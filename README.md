# Reversi-Game

This program uses the JavaFX API to play Reversi against a computer or human aross a server.

Reversi is a strategy board game played on an 8x8 checkerboard where the object of the game is to have the most of your colored tiles on the board.

The rules of the game are as follows:

There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. 
Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. 
During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed 
and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. 
The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.

The game is over when the entire board is covered in tiles, or there are no more playable moves left
